# Lancaster-County-Watershed

Watershed with River Network, Catchment Boundary, and Elevation features for Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia. This makes it easy to visualize the rivers contributing to the watershed. Thus we can gather a sense of where rainwater might go once it hits the ground.

A shapefile of the watershed boundary was used to clip the original DEM. A shapefile of the river network was overlayed. The base map is QuickMapServices OpenStreetMap.
