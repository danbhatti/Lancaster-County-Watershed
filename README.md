# Lancaster-County-Watershed

Created webmap using SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) depicting watershed catchment boundaries/basins and river network/flows. The purpose of the webmap is to show the rivers and catchments of the Susquehanna River Valley that supply Lancaster County's fertile farm soil. Portions of York, Cumberland, Dauphin, Berks, Schuykill, Northumberland, Snyder, Perry, Juniata, Columbia, Montour, Luzerne, and Union County's are also included.

SRTM DEM was downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer, 1-arc second global (id SRTM1N40W077V3). In QGIS, DEM was reprojected from global CRS to local CRS for Pennsylvania South (EPGS 2272). System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) tools were used fill sinks (wang & liu) and to derive the river network (Strahler Order) and watershed basins from the DEM. Rivers of Strahler Order 6 and greater were colored blue to indicate main flows. QuickMapServices OpenStreetMap was used as a basemap. HTML for map website was generated using qgis2web plugin.
